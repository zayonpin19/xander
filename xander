      hi wayne,<br><br>
first of all i just want to say how truly grateful i am to have had you in my life all these years. you've been an amazing boyfriend from the very beginning. you're the sweetest boy i’ve ever met. you’re everything—such a good son, a caring brother, and a loyal friend. i’ve always been proud of you. i’ve seen you grow, and it’s been a blessing to witness that. <br>

i’m sorry if i wasn’t always showy with my love, but please know that i have loved you from the start—and i still do. i really am genuinely thankful for everything you’ve done for me. i’m sorry if i haven’t shown you all the love you deserved. it’s not because i didn’t feel it… i did, with all my heart. <br>
<br>
and i’m sorry too for being an overthinker gf. but i trust you po that’s why i stayed all this time. i held on to your promise na you’ll avoid her. i really thought that was the last time na i’ll say it… but i was wrong. you kept doing it pa, especially at the moments i started to feel okay, when i started to trust again. <br>
<br>
 you know naman how insecure i am to her, base palang sa pag compare mo. i really thought you were on my side—that you'll always have my back. but the way you defended her, the way you chose to connect with her, support her… hindi pa ba yun sapat na i should think over that? you never lied to me before, but when it came to her, you did na. that broke me. you made me feel like she was better than me. and wait—you actually told me that na pala diba? you knew it would hurt me, yet you kept doing it. i’m drained wayne. tired of explaining myself, even over the smallest things—because they mattered to me. i hope someday you’ll realize that, cause everything i did for you, i did with love. and i would never do to you what you’ve done to me. saan ba ko nag kulang? cause i believe i had the right to speak, to feel, to be heard—i was your girlfriend. and even if you stayed wayne. you might never understand how i feel until it happens to you. i hope she knows what boundaries are. and i really really wish na kinampihan mo ako. <br>

but i’m tired now. i kept pushing myself—pasayo—but maybe this time, i need to rest. i’m not giving up on you… but maybe, just for now, i need space to breathe. i’ll try my best to stop reaching out, even if it’s hard. even when we were okay, i cried—every night, sometimes even in the morning. i couldn’t control my emotions anymore. so i’m saying this here, kasi alam kong i wouldn’t be able to say it in person—i’d only end up crying. i’ve always wanted to tell you all this. <br>
<br>

congratulations sa graduation mo love. i’m so proud of you. even if you didn’t make it to the honors, i know you did your best. and that’s more than enough. <br>
<br>
maybe it’s just not our time right now. i’ll try to accept that, even if it hurts—cause maybe it’s for the better. i guess i’m too soft for you. i wish i could handle things better, but i can’t keep pretending i’m okay. <br>
<br>

i miss the old you—the one who never let me sleep upset, the one who never made me cry, who never made me feel like i was asking for too much. you were always on my side. i miss that boy, the one i fell in love with. 
if ever you fall in love again, please… if you love her in the beginning, love her until the end. treat her like she’s not asking for too much—cause love shouldn’t feel like a burden. and i know you’ll be okay without me. you’re living a good life—you’ve got a great family, supportive friends, and everything going for you. you’ll be fine, even if i’m not around anymore. i’ll always wish the best for you. i’ll always pray for your safety, your success, and your happiness. i love you. and i will miss you deeply. but i hope its not the end. reach out for me ha when you know to yourself na you’re sure about me. not thinking about others. just us. i love you wayne <br>
